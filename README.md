My dotfiles

## What I use

 2. Zsh
 3. Tmux

## Install
 1. Clone this repository.
 2. Run the install.sh script, it will backup your current dotfiles to a folder named old_dotfiles.
 3. If you want my home directory structure then run setup-dirs.sh

## Uninstall
 1. Change your shell back to bash if you are going to remove zsh.
 2. Run the uninstall.sh script and move your old dotfiles back.
